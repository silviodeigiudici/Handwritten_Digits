# Handwritten_Digits
It's a software that recognize handwritten digits. I wrote it to learn machine learning and neural nets from scratch.

In the directory there are training set. For now there are only 4 digits but it's simple to extend.

The file net.txt is result of processing learning.

##### TODO:
* Adding comments
* Optimize algorithm and code
* Extend number of digits
* Write it in c++
